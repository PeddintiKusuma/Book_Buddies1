                    <p><strong>Author:</strong> L. P. Hartley, Douglas Brooks-Davies (Introducer) <br>
                        Leslie Poles Hartley was born in 1895 and educated at Harrow and Balliol College, Oxford. He is best known for Facial Justice, the Eustace and Hilda trilogy and The Go-Between, which won the Heinemann Foundation Prize in 1954 and whose opening sentence has become almost proverbial: 'The past is a foreign country: they do things differently there.' He was appointed a CBE in 1955, having won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize in addition to the Heinemann. He died in 1972.</p>

                    <h3>The Master and Margarita</h3>
                    <p><strong>Author:</strong> Mikhail Bulgakov, Will Self (Introducer), Michael Glenny (Translator) <br> Mikhail Bulgakov (1891 - 1940) was born and educated in Kiev where he graduated as a doctor in 1916, but gave up the practice of medicine in 1920 to devote himself to literature. In 1925 he completed the satirical novella The Heart of a Dog, which remained unpublished in the Soviet Union until 1987. This was one of the many defeats he was to suffer at the hands of his censors.

                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> in Bulgakov's allegorical masterpiece of Stalin’s regime the devil is making a personal appearance in Moscow.</p>

                    <h3>Another Country</h3>
                    <p><strong>Author:</strong> James Baldwin, Colm Tóibín (Introducer) <br>James Baldwin was born in 1924 in New York. His first novel, Go Tell It on the Mountain (1953), which evokes his experiences as a boy preacher in Harlem, was an immediate success. Baldwin’s second novel, Giovanni's Room (1956) has become a landmark of gay literature and Another Country (1962) caused a literary sensation. His searing essay collections Notes of a Native Son (1955) and Nobody Knows My Name (1961) contain many of the works that made him an influential figure in the Civil Rights Movement.
